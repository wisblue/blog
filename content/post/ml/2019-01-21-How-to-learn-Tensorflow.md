While dealing with TensorFlow for the first time I found the [tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/) on the official website slightly difficult to understand.

\+ Here are some quick reads before you dive into actual programming of TensorFlow (to understand structure and flow of language): **(Expected amount of time: 30min to 1 hour.)**

- [Python TensorFlow Tutorial - Build a Neural Network - Adventures in Machine Learning](http://adventuresinmachinelearning.com/python-tensorflow-tutorial/)
- [TensorFlow Tutorial: 10 minutes Practical TensorFlow lesson for quick learners](http://cv-tricks.com/artificial-intelligence/deep-learning/deep-learning-frameworks/tensorflow-tutorial/)

\+ Next, start with [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052289.do) from chapter 9 and after you finish chapter 11 you can go back to the [tutorials on the official website](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/), they will start making sense :). After completion you will have basic understanding of TensorFlow. **(Expected amount of time: 3–4 days)**

\+ If you would like to move to the next level, follow the same book and complete chapters 12 till 16. During this phase, I also find this website ( [Learning TensorFlow ::](https://learningtensorflow.com/index.html)) to be very helpful. **(Expected amount of time: 4–5 days)**

At the end of the day, the more you practice the better you will become at TensorFlow. Here are some useful GitHub repositories:
